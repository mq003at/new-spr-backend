# SPR-Kirppis

Hi, my name is Quan, a student from Centria UAS. For this project, I make a SPR-Kirppis as an web app to handle employee's info. The web app uses Reactjs as frontend and Nodejs as backend


## Instalation
You can clone this project using 

    git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2

After that, you can go to frontend directory to change some codes. When you are done, go to backend/api directory and build the static version of React using

    npm run build

Aditionally, if you have already built the project before, you can use `npm run build-no-i` to skip the installation process. Then, to start serving the project from localhost, you can start the server by using this command from the api folder. 

    npm start
The project will be hosted at http://localhost:3001/
